**Kaggle Competition Submission: Spaceship Titanic (Binary Classification)**  
This repository contains my submission for the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) machine learning competition on Kaggle. The goal was to predict which passengers were transported to another dimension using classification models.

## 📁 Contents

- `titanicspacemodal.ipynb` – Data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation
- `submission.csv` – Final predictions submitted to Kaggle
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 🧠 What I Did

- Cleaned missing data using logical inference and grouping
- Engineered features like spending flags, deck-region mappings, and group-based imputation
- Trained and evaluated multiple models using pipelines
- Achieved a strong accuracy score on Kaggle leaderboard

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📈 Outcome

This project sharpened my skills in binary classification, feature engineering, and real-world competition pipelines. I am continuously improving and exploring more advanced modeling.
